### Description

A small excel dashboard to show the line productivity on a toy dataset. The objecive was to showcase key insights into line productivity.

The objective of this project was to create a dynamic dashboard that provides insights to answer the following recommended analysis;
1) What's the current line efficiency? (total time / min time)
2) Are any operators underperforming?
3) What are the leading factors for downtime?
4) Do any operators struggle with particular types of operator error?

This dashboard allows stakeholders to gain a clear understanding of worker's performance, and overall line productivity.
